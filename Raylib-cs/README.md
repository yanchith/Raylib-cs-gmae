[![Build](https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild)

Raylib-cs targets net5.0 and net6.0.

## Installation - NuGet

This is the prefered method to get started.

```
dotnet add package Raylib-cs
```

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/raylib-cs)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Raylib-cs/)

If you need to edit Raylib-cs source then you will need to add the bindings as a project (see below).

If you are new to using NuGet (or you've forgotten) and are trying to run the above command in the command prompt,
remember that you need to be *inside the intended project directory* (not just inside the solution directory) otherwise
the command won't work.

## Installation - Manual

1. Download/clone the repo

2. Add [Raylib-cs/Raylib-cs.csproj](Raylib-cs/Raylib-cs.csproj) to your project as an existing project.

3. Download the native libraries for the platforms you want to build for using the [official 4.5.0 release](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/tag/4.5.0).
   **NOTE: the MSVC version is required for Windows platforms**

4. **(Recommended)** Put the native library for each platform under `Raylib-cs/runtimes/{platform}/native/`
   **(Optional)** If you want to handle the native libraries yourself, make sure they are either in the same directory as the executable and/or can be found in the search path. See https://www.mono-project.com/docs/advanced/pinvoke/ for details.

5. Start coding!

## Hello, World!

```csharp
using Raylib_cs;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    static class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Raylib.InitWindow(800, 480, "Hello World");

            while (!Raylib.WindowShouldClose())
            {
                Raylib.BeginDrawing();
                Raylib.ClearBackground(Color.WHITE);

                Raylib.DrawText("Hello, world!", 12, 12, 20, Color.BLACK);

                Raylib.EndDrawing();
            }

            Raylib.CloseWindow();
        }
    }
}
```
